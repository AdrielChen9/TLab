For data-dependent acquisition (DDA), 
the MS1 scan resolution was set to 60K  
(at m/z 200). The MS1 scan range was 350-1350 m/z, 
the AGC target was 100%, and the maximum injection time was 
118 ms.Precursor ions with charge states of 
2-5were isolated with the Quadrupole 
mass filter and fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation 
(HCD) at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 36%. 
The first mass was set to  110, the AGC target was 300%, 
and the maximum injection time was 250 ms for
 resolution of 50K.
