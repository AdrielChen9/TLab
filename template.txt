#MasterScan

For data-dependent acquisition (DDA), 
the MS1 scan resolution was set to {Orbitrap Resolution}  
(at m/z 200). The MS1 scan range was {Scan Range (m/z)} m/z, 
the AGC target was {Normalized AGC Target}, and the maximum injection time was 
{Maximum Injection Time (ms)} ms. 

#Charge state
Precursor ions with charge states of 
{Include charge state(s)} 

#DDMSN
were isolated with the {Isolation Mode} 
mass filter and fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation 
(HCD) at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of {Collision Energy (%)}%. 
The first mass was set to  {FirstMass}, the AGC target was {Normalized AGC Target}, 
and the maximum injection time was {Maximum Injection Time (ms)} ms for
 resolution of {Orbitrap Resolution}.
